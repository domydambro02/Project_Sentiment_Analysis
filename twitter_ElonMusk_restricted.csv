"🇩🇪GERMANY CONDEMNS ATTACK ON TESLA GIGAFACTORY\n\nCalling the attack “a form of terrorism,” German politician Dietmar Woidke said: “It is obviously a serious attack on our critical infrastructure with consequences for thousands of people as well as many small and large businesses in our country.”\n\nLeft-wing extremists, the Vulkan Group, have claimed responsibility for the attack, stating they wanted to “shut down Tesla.”\n\nThe power supply has now been restored to the Gigafactory.\n\nSource: NTV",503
"@MarioNawfal These are either the dumbest eco-terrorists on Earth or they’re puppets of those who don’t have good environmental goals. \n\nStopping production of electric vehicles, rather than fossil fuel vehicles, ist extrem dumm.",231

@MarioNawfal What's going on?😮,30
@MarioNawfal Wow this is how bad these places have become 🪦,59

@MarioNawfal Thank you!,23
@MarioNawfal 😲,14
"@MarioNawfal ""The power supply has now been restored to the Gigafactory"" \n&lt;-- fully restored such that production can resume? Or just partly restored for essentials?",169
@MarioNawfal Either organized by frustrated unionists or legacy auto or collusion between the two!!,99
@MarioNawfal I thought the Left was pro-EV 😂,44
@MarioNawfal I guess they are mad because Tesla is solving the renewable &amp; climate problem and proving we don’t need to destroy society to do it. If you hate society and your identity is wrapped around needing a permanent crisis what else are you going to do?,263
@MarioNawfal What could be the long-term consequences of such attacks on critical infrastructure for Germany and its relationship with foreign investors?,153
"In times of uncertainty and volatility, it is crucial to safeguard our critical infrastructure, as it serves as the foundation for our societal resilience and economic stability. The implications of such attacks ripple far beyond the immediate impact, affecting countless individuals and businesses interconnected within the ecosystem. #StayVigilant",349
@MarioNawfal These guys need educating. Do they realize they are protesting the company trying to transition the world to sustainable energy?,141

It's unfortunate when actions intended to promote environmental causes end up having counterproductive effects. Targeting electric vehicle production seems contradictory to environmental goals. It's essential to advocate for strategies that effectively reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainable practices in alignment with broader environmental objectives.,362

@elonmusk @MarioNawfal You are right,36
@elonmusk @MarioNawfal You are right.,37

When we attended in 2021 we spent a good 4 hours touring the factory (yes we're geeks) and speaking with as many local people (albeit in poor German / English) as possible and they all loved Tesla. Maybe Tesla refused the negative people from attending (not sure how they would know) or maybe it's just a tiny minority that actually are negative about the factory... The fact remains that the trees planted around this factory were planted to be cut down... you can tell as they were all planted in neat rows and extremely close to one another which forces them to grow tall quickly which makes them ideal for making things from.\n\nIf this was a petrol chemical factory or a new BMW factory for petrol cars I'd understand it but it's a factory producing electric cars which can be charged from sun or wind power and are infinitely better for the environment than petrol and diesel cars 🤷‍♂️\n\nOh and Tesla are planting 3x the number of trees (albeit 60+ miles away)...,970
@elonmusk @MarioNawfal I'm truly sorry that something like this can happen here in Germany. 🇩🇪 \n\nTruly sad 😔,110
